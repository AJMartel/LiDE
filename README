Hermes is a very small, very simple fileserver. To host a file, do

$ ./hermes my_file

then to retrieve it on another host, do something like

$ nc <server host> 9999 > my_file

Hermes defaults to TCP/9999, but the port can be specified with -p.
If you want a (limited) amount of verbosity, use -v.
