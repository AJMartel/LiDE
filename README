LiDE is a small fileserver. To host a file, do

$ ./lide FileToSend

then to retrieve it on another host, do something like

$ netcat <LiDE_host_IP> 31337 > ReceivedFile

LiDE defaults to TCP/31337, but the port can be specified with -p.


Example 

From local PC execute the following to make the file available on the network:
***This will copy the file to the remote system and execute it.

$ tar cf - ./lide | ssh <RemoteUser>@<RemoteIP> 'tar xf -; ./lide FileToSend'

In another terminal on the local PC execute the following to retrieve the file:

$ netcat <RemoteIP> 31337 > ReceivedFile && md5sum ReceivedFile
