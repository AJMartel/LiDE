What is LiDE?
============
Linux Disk Extractor: The linux cat/dd command extended across networks. 
It helps you copy files across networks. 
You may copy a full disk, a partition or a file using this command.

Example usage
=============
    There is a disk called /dev/sda on ipaddress 192.168.1.1.
    There is another disk called /dev/sdb on ipaddress 192.168.1.2.
    Now to copy /dev/sda@192.168.1.1 to /dev/sda@192.168.1.2, 
    run the following command:
	On 192.168.1.1:
	    $ lide /dev/sda
	On 192.168.1.2:
	    netcat 192.168.1.1 31337 > /dev/sda && md5sum ReceivedFile.tst
    
    LiDE defaults to TCP/31337, but the port can be specified with -p.
	On 192.168.1.1:
	    $ lide -p 8888 FileToSend
	On 192.168.1.2:
	    netcat 192.168.1.1 8888 > ReceivedFile && md5sum ReceivedFile

To execute lide on a remote system from local PC, 
execute the following to make the file available on the network:
tar cf - ./lide | ssh forensics@192.168.1.1 'tar xf -; ./lide FileToSend'
***This will copy the file to the remote system and execute it.
