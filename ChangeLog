LiDE "Linux Disk Extractor"

As of version 0.0.3.0 it has the same functionality as running a string of commands:
-dd to capture a file (more like cat though)
-pv "pipe viewer" to view the progress of the file transfer
-netcat to send the file over the network
-md5sum to report the unique file hash, in order to confirm a 100% good file transfer
-ifconfig to report the local IP address
All packaged into a small executable less than 19Kb in size.

The following command could accomplish the same results:
ifconfig | grep -A1 eth0 | grep inet | cut -f2 -d ":" | cut -f1 -d " " && md5sum File_to_Transfer && cat File_to_Transfer | pv | nc -l -p 31337
